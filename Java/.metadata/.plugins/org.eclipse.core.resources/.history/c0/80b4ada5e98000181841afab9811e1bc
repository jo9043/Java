Mr. 16
and 21
Mrs. 8
Dursley, 2
of 20
number 2
four, 1
Privet 3
Drive, 2
were 7
proud 1
to 14
say 2
that 13
they 12
perfectly 2
normal, 2
thank 1
you 2
very 4
much. 1
the 46
last 1
people 6
you'd 1
expect 1
be 5
involved 1
in 15
anything 1
strange 2
or 2
mysterious, 1
because 3
just 1
didn't 6
hold 1
with 4
such 1
nonsense. 1
Dursley 18
was 18
director 1
a 27
firm 1
called 2
Grunnings, 1
which 2
made 2
drills. 2
He 25
big, 1
beefy 1
man 2
hardly 1
any 1
neck, 2
although 1
did 1
have 5
large 2
mustache. 1
thin 1
blonde 1
had 10
nearly 1
twice 1
usual 2
amount 1
came 1
useful 1
as 10
she 3
spent 1
so 1
much 1
her 3
time 1
craning 1
over 2
garden 1
fences, 1
spying 1
on 13
neighbors. 1
Dursleys 4
small 2
son 1
Dudley 5
their 2
opinion 1
there 5
no 1
finer 1
boy 2
anywhere. 1
everything 1
wanted, 1
but 7
also 1
secret, 1
greatest 1
fear 1
somebody 1
would 4
discover 1
it. 2
think 2
could 2
bear 2
it 8
if 3
anyone 1
found 2
out 5
about 2
Potters. 1
Potter 1
Dursley's 1
sister, 2
hadn't 1
met 1
for 5
several 2
years; 1
fact, 1
pretended 1
sister 1
good-for-nothing 1
husband 1
unDursleyish 1
possible 1
be. 1
shuddered 1
what 3
neighbors 1
Potters 3
arrived 2
street. 1
knew 1
son, 1
too, 1
never 2
even 2
seen 3
him. 1
This 3
another 1
good 2
reason 1
keeping 1
away; 1
want 1
mixing 1
child 1
like 1
that. 1
When 2

hummed 1
picked 2
his 15
most 2
boring 1
tie 1
work, 1
gossiped 1
away 1
happily 1
wrestled 1
screaming 1
into 2
high 1
chair. 1
None 1
them 3
noticed 2
large, 1
tawny 1

At 7
